# Variadic Functions in C 🎉

This project explores the use of variadic functions, the `const` keyword, and related concepts in C programming 📚. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these topics while adhering to specific coding standards and requirements 📝.

## Resources 📖

- [stdarg.h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdarg.h) 📚
- [Variadic Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function) 💡
- [Const Keyword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Const_(computer_programming)) 🔒

## Learning Objectives 🎯

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- The concept and implementation of variadic functions 🤔
- Usage of `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end` macros 📝
- Purpose and application of the `const` type qualifier 🔑

## Requirements 📋

### General 🌟

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs 📝
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 🖥️
- All files should end with a new line 📄
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory 📚
- Code should follow the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl 🎨
- Global variables are not allowed 🚫
- No more than 5 functions per file 📊
- Allowed C standard library functions: malloc, free, exit ✅
- Forbidden functions: printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc. 🚫
- Allowed macros: va_start, va_arg, va_end ✅
- You can use _putchar 👍
- Don't push _putchar.c, we'll use our file (if you do, it won't be taken into account) ℹ️
- main.c files are provided as examples for testing, but don't push them to your repo 🧪
- We'll use our own main.c files for compilation, which may differ from the examples 🔄
- All function prototypes, including _putchar, should be in the header file variadic_functions.h 📁
- Don't forget to push your header file 📤
- All header files should be include guarded 🛡️
