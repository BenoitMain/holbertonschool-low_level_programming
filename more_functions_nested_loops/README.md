# C Programming: Functions and Nested Loops 🔄

## Resources 📚

### Read or watch:

- **Nested while loops** 🔄
- **C - Functions** 🔧
- **Learning to Program in C (Part 06)** (stop at 14:00) 🎬
- **What is the purpose of a function prototype?** ❓
- **C - Header Files** (stop before the “Once-Only Headers” paragraph) 📂

## Learning Objectives 🎯

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- What are nested loops and how to use them. 🔄
- What is a function and how do you use functions. 🔧
- What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function. 📜
- What is a prototype. 📜
- Scope of variables. 🔍
- What are the gcc flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`. 🛠️
- What are header files and how to use them with `#include`. 📂

## Requirements 📜

### General

- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`. ✏️
- **Compilation**: All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`. 🛠️
- **File format**: All your files should end with a new line. 📄
- **Documentation**: A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory. 📜
- **Code style**: Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`. 💅
- **Global variables**: You are not allowed to use global variables. ❌
- **Function limit**: No more than 5 functions per file. 🔢
- **Standard library**: You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., is forbidden. ❌
- **Allowed function**: You are allowed to use `_putchar`. ✅
- **`_putchar.c` file**: You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account. 📁
- **Example `main.c` files**: The `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo. We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. 📁
- **Prototypes**: The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`. 📜
- **Header file**: Don’t forget to push your header file. 📁

## More Info 📌

You do not have to understand the call by reference (address), stack, static variables, recursions, or arrays yet.
