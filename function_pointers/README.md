# Project: Function Pointers in C 🖥️

## Description 📜

This project focuses on the use of function pointers in C. The goal is to understand and manipulate function pointers to better understand virtual memory and how functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone (without Google’s help):

- What function pointers are and how to use them 🧑‍💻
- What exactly a function pointer holds 🔍
- Where a function pointer points to in virtual memory 🌐

## Resources 📚

Here are some resources to help you better understand function pointers in C:

- [Function Pointer in C](https://example.com)
- [Pointers to functions](https://example.com)
- [Function Pointers in C / C++](https://example.com)
- [Why pointers to functions?](https://example.com)
- [Everything you need to know about pointers in C](https://example.com)

## Requirements ⚙️

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs ✍️
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the following options:
  `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files must end with a new line 📄
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory 📑
- Your code must follow the Betty style, which will be checked using the `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` scripts 🧑‍💻
- You are not allowed to use global variables 🚫
- No more than 5 functions per file ⚖️
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc. is forbidden 🚫
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`, but you don’t need to push the `_putchar.c` file to your repository. We will use our own `_putchar.c` file, and if you push it, it won’t be considered ❌
- The `main.c` file is provided as an example to test your functions, but you are not required to push it to your repository. We will use our own `main.c` file for compilation, which may differ from the one shown in the examples 📝

### Header File 🏷️

- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the `_putchar` function should be included in your header file named `function_pointers.h` 📂
- Don’t forget to push your header file 🔁
- All your header files should be include guarded 🔐
